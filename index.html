		<h2>Delorean Ipsum1</h2>
		<p>Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary? What did I just say? So tell me, future boy, who's president of the United States in 1985? Are you sure about this storm? Now remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you repair the damages, you will be next. </p>

			<p>No, I refuse to except the responsibility. Huh? Oh no, don't touch that. That's some new specialized weather sensing equipment. Alright, let's set your destination time. This is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm goes off you hit the gas. I'm sure that in 1985, plutonium is available at every corner drug store, but in 1955, it's a little hard to come by. Marty, I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're stuck here.</p>

			<h2>Delorean Ipsum3</h2>
			<p>Never mind that now, never mind that now. The storm. That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world series. Oh, just a little weather experiment. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous.</p>

			<h2>Delorean Ipsum4</h2>
			<p>Quiet. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. You bet. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Precisely.</p>

			<h2>Delorean Ipsum5</h2>
			<p>It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. Who do you think, the Libyans. Don't worry. As long as you hit that wire with the connecting hook at precisely 88 miles per hour, the instance the lightning strikes the tower, everything will be fine. You bet. The storm.</p>
